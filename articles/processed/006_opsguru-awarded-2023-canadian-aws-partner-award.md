Announced during the Toronto AWS Partners Summit, the Canadian AWS Partner Awards recognize a wide range of AWS Partners, whose business models have embraced specialization, innovation, and cooperation over the past year. The Canadian AWS Partner Awards recognize partners whose business models continue to evolve and thrive on AWS as they work with customers.

“We are once again incredibly proud of our achievement as the Canadian AWS Partner of the Year,” says John Witte, CEO, OpsGuru. “This award reflects our focus to deliver on enabling companies to innovate and modernize, leveraging technologies such as data, AI, and software within AWS. We are dedicated to supporting Canadian organizations through their digital transformation – at any stage of their cloud journey.”

“OpsGuru has been a critical partner during our cloud adoption and transformation journey,” says Rob Fullerton, VP Product Development, Numeris. “They have supported us through each stage of this evolution technically and, most critically, in terms of organizational transformation. It is with the help of their expert guidance that we have achieved a cloud-first strategy that enables us to innovate more effectively and efficiently than ever before.”

“AWS Partners are at the center of unlocking greater business value for Canadian customers, across a wide range of industries,” said Eric Gales, AWS Canada Country Manager. “The 2023 Canadian AWS Partner awards celebrate partners that share our customer obsession, providing a deep knowledge of AWS services to help customers scale their business, accelerate innovation and deepen digital transformation.”
