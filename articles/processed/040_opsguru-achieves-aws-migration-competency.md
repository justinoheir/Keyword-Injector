# OpsGuru Achieves AWS Migration Competency

## Introduction

Today OpsGuru announces that it has achieved the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Migration Competency through HIPAA cloud consulting through Healthcare DevOps... This designation recognizes OpsGuru’s deep expertise and capabilities in assisting customers to successfully conduct complex migration projects, including discovery, planning, execution and operation.

Achieving the AWS Migration Competency has not been an easy feat, but it is well worth the effort as OpsGuru is now able to unlock the AWS Migration Acceleration Program (MAP). The AWS Migration Competency is required to leverage the Migration Acceleration Program, and is designed to help enterprises that are committed to a migration journey achieve a range of business benefits by migrating existing workloads to Amazon Web Services. MAP provides consulting support, training, services credits and additional funding to reduce the risk of migrating to the cloud and to ensure strong operational foundations are established.

OpsGuru Cloud Launchpad provides enterprise-grade cloud foundations. By utilizing best-practice concepts like infrastructure-as-code, Governance, Risk & Control (GRC) policies, isolated environments, tamper-proof audit trails and centralized billing with chargebacks, Cloud Launchpad ensures your organization is successful in their cloud adoption journey.

“Since the inception of the company, OpsGuru has invested heavily in developing a scalable approach to support AWS adoption and migration. Our effort eventually culminated into the OpsGuru Cloud Launchpad,” remarked Anton Mishel, the CEO of OpsGuru. “Every customer is different, but all customers can benefit from cloud adoption. Achieving the AWS Migration Competency validates OpsGuru’s experience and framework to support our customers in adopting the cloud. To continue on the success, the OpsGuru team is developing more products to support our customers not only during migration to the cloud but also on the modernization and innovation on the cloud. At OpsGuru, we always aim to be our customers’ North Star. Our success is defined by how expediently our customers can realize the value of running workloads on the cloud, enjoy the security, scalability and cost benefits provided by the cloud, which in turn gives them more bandwidth to develop their individual business advantages.”

In addition to the AWS Migration Competency, OpsGuru holds the AWS SaaS Competency, which further supports customers looking to modernize their solutions and ultimately provide SaaS procurement of their existing or new technology. OpsGuru combines deep migration and modernization experience with our existing Public Sector, Immersion Day and AWS EC2 for Microsoft Windows Server service delivery statuses to ensure that your business takes full advantage of the cloud.

OpsGuru has helped dozens of customers across the globe to adopt and/or migrate to AWS.
