# OpsGuru Pioneers Launch of Professional Services within the AWS Marketplace

## Introduction

OpsGuru is proud to be distinguished as a launch partner of Professional Services on the AWS Marketplace with Cloud-native DevOps.. This program allows our AWS customers to procure our Professional Services through their existing AWS billing arrangements. While the cloud has made infrastructure provisioning much simpler, AWS adopters must ensure that they are adopting the cloud scalably, securely and cost-effectively. The AWS partner ecosystem plays a critical role in assisting customers to navigate the often complex cloud design paradigms, best practices and technology innovations. A true partner doesn’t just sell technology, a true partner offers a solution through the use of technologies to drive your competitive edge. OpsGuru navigates these complex trends and expediently implements and deploys technology-based solutions to real-world business problems.

If your organization has an existing AWS billing relationship, Professional Services in the AWS Marketplace can help you to accelerate your procurement of OpsGuru AWS Professional Services. OpsGuru is proud to be one of the few launch partners for this innovative program.
