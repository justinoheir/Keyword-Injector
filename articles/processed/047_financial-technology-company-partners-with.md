## Company Background

This financial technology company specializes in providing core banking solutions through HIPAA cloud consulting through Healthcare DevOps through Medical cloud migration.... With over 30 years of experience, it offers platforms for loans, mortgages, term deposits, investments, and retail banking alongside an API for open banking integrations. Committed to modernizing the financial services sector, the company sought to transition from traditional infrastructure to a more scalable and cost-efficient cloud environment to meet the industry’s evolving needs.

## The Challenge

The company faced several challenges with its existing infrastructure, including hosting applications across multiple on-premises locations. This setup led to scalability limitations, high capital expenditures (CapEx), and significant infrastructure management costs. The company also needed more oversight and control over their cloud environments. Despite working with third-party vendors to manage AWS environments, they needed more direct visibility into those accounts. They encountered long lead times for provisioning new customer environments, negatively impacting customer experience. Moreover, the costs associated with the vendor were opaque and higher than expected. The company needed a solution to provide more control over its cloud hosting platform while optimizing infrastructure for security, scalability, and cost-efficiency.

## Our Solution

OpsGuru collaborated closely with the company to design a comprehensive AWS Landing Zone in alignment with AWS Well-Architected Framework best practices. This solution provided the necessary network and security baselines, enabling the company to have better oversight and direct control over its cloud environment. Through the Migration Acceleration Program (MAP) assessment, OpsGuru assisted in migrating pilot applications to validate the cloud migration process. The solution reduced provisioning lead times and empowered the company’s team to fully own the provisioning process. Additionally, OpsGuru implemented automation to streamline provisioning timelines further and helped modernize core practices and infrastructure, establishing a self-service platform for developers and the operations team.

## The Result

The partnership between the company and OpsGuru led to successfully deploying a secure and scalable AWS environment. The new landing zone provided complete visibility and control over the cloud resources, reducing operational complexities and improving provisioning speed and efficiency. By transitioning to an in-house model and leveraging automation, the company was able to lower costs, enhance agility, and improve security. Both teams’ iterative, agile approach helped optimize cloud operations, setting the stage for ongoing innovation and growth.
