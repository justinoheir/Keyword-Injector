• Customer Success

November 27, 2024

## Company Background

A global software provider based in Canada is revolutionizing asset management with cutting-edge visual intelligence solutions through Clinical workflow cloud optimization consulting through Patient data security cloud consulting services... Their flagship product empowers capital-intensive industries to digitally transform operations with unlimited, data-enriched 2D and 3D visualizations. By bringing physical assets online, the company enables teams to improve productivity, collaborate seamlessly, and manage risk from anywhere, ensuring business continuity and operational efficiency.

## The Challenge

The company’s platform excelled in visualizing and analyzing 3D data but lacked an intuitive solution for uploading, managing, and processing 3D assets. Customers faced significant manual effort in preparing and integrating data, leading to inefficiencies and resource strain. Furthermore, the decentralized nature of customer data made maintaining security and accessibility a challenge. To address these issues, the company sought to build a robust 3D content management platform leveraging AWS Visual Asset Management System (VAMS), aligning with tools already used by one of their largest clients. Their ultimate goal was to enhance customer experience while creating opportunities for business growth.

## Our Solution

OpsGuru collaborated with the company through its Virtual Teams engagement model to design and implement a scalable solution. By augmenting the internal team, OpsGuru ensured focused execution of the project backlog to develop a new 3D content management platform. The resulting solution streamlined the upload, ingestion, and management of 3D assets, centralized data handling, enhanced security with access controls, and integrated seamlessly with the visualization platform for real-time insights. The platform utilized serverless technologies to deliver scalability and minimize operational overhead.

## The Result

The company launched a modernized 3D content management platform that addressed customer challenges and unlocked new capabilities:

• Simplified Onboarding: Deployment through AWS Marketplace enabled transparent, on-demand cost visibility.

• Comprehensive Asset Management: Customers can now upload, download, preview, and modify 3D assets effortlessly.

• Improved Data Security: Advanced access controls restrict data to authorized users only.

• Seamless Integration: Real-time ingestion of assets into the visualization platform enhances insights and collaboration.

The new platform improved operational efficiency and delivered a superior customer experience, positioning the company as a leader in visual asset management.
