# OpsGuru Achieves the AWS Resilience Competency

OpsGuru announced today that it has achieved the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Resilience Services Competency in the Core Resilience category. This specialization recognizes OpsGuru as an AWS Partner that provides validated solutions to help customers improve their critical systems availability and resilience posture using AWS Resilience Services. As each customer and their critical workloads have unique availability requirements, AWS Resilience Competency Partners provide tailored guidance and solutions to achieve the highest system uptime needs. Trust in AWS Resilience Competency Partners to deliver top-notch services that meet your organization’s resilience needs in today’s dynamic business landscape.

Complex systems are susceptible to a variety of failures, both small and large, throughout their lifespan, including code deployment issues, infrastructure problems, data and state failures, and natural disasters. As a result, organizations must plan for and expect system failures, and design their systems to withstand and recover from failures with minimal impact to end users. Remote teams, distributed systems, and frequent releases further highlight the need for increased resilience in today’s business environment.

Achieving the AWS Resilience Competency in the Core Resilience category differentiates OpsGuru as an AWS Partner that has demonstrated technical proficiency and proven customer success supporting customers’ resilience goals. OpsGuru is equipped to handle resilience related application challenges, especially as expectations from customers shift towards an ‘always on, always available’ mindset. It’s important for organizations to expect and plan for system failures, and design workloads to recover from failure in a way that minimally impacts their end users. Additionally, when onboarding critical workloads to the cloud, such as online banking, stock-trading, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERPs) or online sales platforms, higher uptime requirements have become a minimal requirement. AWS Resilience Competency Partner OpsGuru provides professional consulting and engineering services that are validated by AWS experts in the Core Resilience category. This standardized approach allows customers to achieve their resilience goals in the cloud with the expert assistance of AWS Resilience Competency Partners.

“OpsGuru is thrilled to announce our achievement of the AWS Resilience Competency,” declared CTO Robin Percy. “With the imminent launch of AWS’s new region in Calgary, we’re uniquely positioned to accelerate cloud resilience across Canada’s business landscape. Companies seeking best-of-breed resilient solutions can leverage our validated expertise and services for unparalleled results.”

In addition to the AWS Resilience Services Competency, OpsGuru also holds the AWS DevOps Competency, the AWS Migration Competency, the AWS SaaS Competency, Microsoft Workloads Competency and the AWS Networking Competency.
