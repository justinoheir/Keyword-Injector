# A Leading Engagement Platform’s Journey to the Cloud: Modernizing for Scalability and Efficiency

## Company Background

This purpose-driven engagement platform provides solutions that power B2B social recognition, loyalty, rewards, and incentive programs. Its key offerings include a customizable engagement solution for enterprises and SMBs, a platform providing global access to millions of global curated rewards, and a free shop-and-save program for employers. The company is committed to sustainability through its mission to plant millions of trees annually to combat climate change.

## The Challenge

The company’s existing on-premises e-commerce platform faced significant scalability, performance, and cost-efficiency challenges. To support future growth, reduce latency, and optimize Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), the company sought expert guidance to migrate its workloads to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Ensuring security reliability and building a compelling business case for the migration were critical priorities for leadership.

## Our Solution

OpsGuru collaborated closely with the company to develop a secure and scalable AWS foundation using the Cloud Launchpad framework. This included implementing essential security guardrails such as temporary credentials, centralized login, network segregation, and a centralized security escrow account for audit logging.

The solution leveraged Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) for high availability and scalability, supported by managed services like Amazon RDS for MySQL, Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached and Redis, and Amazon Elastic File System (EFS). OpsGuru’s team also provided Terraform code to automate and implement the architecture, ensuring compliance with the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

## The Result

OpsGuru delivered a robust and modernized AWS platform tailored to the company’s specific needs. The migration reduced operational complexities, improved scalability, and lowered latency, enabling the company to achieve more significant growth and operational efficiency. The company now operates on a reliable cloud foundation that supports its business objectives and sustainability initiatives.
