# Make Knowledge Sharing Effective with Amazon Q Business

## Introduction

• Data and AI

• Generative AI

• Innovation

Effective knowledge sharing across an organization is crucial for success. However, many organizations struggle with this—approximately 40% of participants in a McKinsey survey reported that complicated organizational structures are causing inefficiency. Information often remains siloed within individual departments or teams, hindering collaboration and innovation due to complex systems.

In 2025, business leaders must look to technological advancements like Generative AI to boost efficiency with limited resources. Below, we’ll discuss the components of an effective knowledge management system and how you can achieve it with Amazon Q Business.

## What is Knowledge Sharing?

Knowledge sharing happens when teams and departments exchange information, skills, and insights to work better together and make smarter decisions. It covers everything from formal reports and presentations to casual tips and real-world know-how.

When information is easy to find and share, teams stay aligned and avoid working in silos. With business moving faster than ever, tools like GenAI can help by connecting different data sources and making it easier to uncover the knowledge that matters.

## 7 Components of an Effective Knowledge Sharing System

Success in information sharing depends not only on effective systems, but also on maintaining the quality and security of that shared information. Maintaining accurate and up-to-date information across different formats while also prioritizing information security can become challenging, ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible to those who need it.

An effective knowledge sharing system is made up of 7 key areas:

1\. Capture: the collection of explicit (e.g. documents and guides) and tacit knowledge (e.g. insights and best practices).

2\. Organization: a structure for information with clear categories, tags, and metadata.

3\. Storage: secure, scalable repositories to centralize content, like the cloud.

4\. Sharing & access: intuitive search and collaboration tools.

5\. Application: embedding knowledge into workflows, training, and decision-making.

6\. Governance: maintaining accuracy with regular updates, ownership, and compliance.

7\. Measurement: tracking usage and impact to drive continuous improvement.

Effectively sharing knowledge also relies heavily on employees. Finding and utilizing the right information can be time-consuming and challenging. Employees may not even be aware of the existence of critical information, leading to missed opportunities and inefficient workflows.

## How You Can Use GenAI to Improve Knowledge Sharing

Employees are wasting valuable time searching for what they need. GenAI can act as a bridge between systems, seamlessly integrating with platforms like Confluence, SharePoint, and customer relationship management (CRM) tools like Salesforce and HubSpot to boost productivity and efficiency.

Unified access

Imagine a sales representative accessing relevant customer data from the CRM in real time, product information from Confluence, and past sales records from the company database—all within a single, intuitive interface. This unified access eliminates the need for employees to navigate multiple systems and manually consolidate information, streamlining workflows and improving efficiency.

Intelligent analysis

GenAI can intelligently analyze and prioritize information based on factors like age, quality, and relevance. This ensures that employees are presented with the most up-to-date and reliable information, empowering them to make more informed decisions and improve the quality of their work.

Improved organization and accessibility

Beyond improved access, GenAI can enhance the organization and accessibility of existing knowledge. By analyzing documents and identifying key themes and concepts, GenAI can automatically tag and categorize information, making it easier for employees to find the specific information they need. This improved discoverability reduces the time spent searching for information and empowers employees to locate relevant knowledge quickly, improving overall productivity.

Security measures

Security is paramount in any enterprise system, and GenAI assistants are no exception. Robust security measures are essential to protect sensitive organizational data. These security measures—combined with continuous monitoring and vulnerability assessments–help safeguard sensitive information and ensure that only authorized personnel can access and utilize the information within the platform.

## Amazon Q Business Brings GenAI-Powered Knowledge Sharing to Life

Amazon Q Business embodies these principles by acting as a central hub that integrates with a diverse range of data sources, internal databases, and Amazon services like Amazon Relational Database Services (RDS) and Amazon S3. This comprehensive data integration provides employees with a unified access point to information scattered across various systems, eliminating the need to navigate multiple platforms.

Amazon Q Business leverages powerful machine learning algorithms to rank and prioritize information based on relevance, recency, and source credibility. Administrators can refine this ranking by prioritizing certain documents or data sources through boosting metadata. With multiple data sources, a higher-ranked data source will be searched first for the answer before the lower-ranked ones. For example, information from the CRM could be given higher priority than general company news.

Amazon Q Business incorporates robust security measures, including:

• Data Encryption at Rest and in Transit: Amazon Q Business is tightly integrated with AWS Key Management Systems (KMS), so encryption at rest can be implemented using either Customer-managed keys or AWS-owned AWS KMS keys. Amazon Q Business also uses the HTTPS protocol for data in transit.

• Fine-grained access control: Information access is tightly controlled through integration with the IAM Identity Center (or IAM Federation). This ensures that only authorized personnel can access the information they are entitled to based on multiple factors. For example, a sales representative can access customer data, but not sensitive HR information.

• Data privacy: Customer data remains within the customer’s control and is not used to train or improve the underlying AI models without explicit consent.

By leveraging these capabilities, Amazon Q Business empowers organizations to break down information silos, improve information discoverability, enhance information quality, and ensure the security of their valuable knowledge assets. This ultimately enables employees to make more informed decisions, improve productivity, and drive innovation across the organization.

## The ROI of Knowledge Empowerment
