# Official Announcement: Appointment of New Chief Executive Officer

## Introduction

Today marks a significant moment in OpsGuru’s journey, as we are pleased announce the promotion of our EVP and CFO, Ryan Smyth, to the role of President and CEO. Since joining the organization, Ryan has been an invaluable member of the OpsGuru team, demonstrating a strong commitment to the AWS partnership, a laser-focus on providing exceptional service to our customers, and a deep understanding of our industry and its market dynamics. Prior to joining the company, he held progressively more senior leadership roles across a broad range of technology sectors.

We also want to recognize our outgoing President and CEO, John Witte, who has decided to retire. John’s visionary leadership and unwavering commitment to excellence over the past 3 years has been instrumental in shaping OpsGuru into the thriving organization it is today.

Please join us in wishing John all the best on his retirement and congratulating Ryan on his well-deserved appointment\!
