# OpsGuru joining FoodX-led Consortium on Food Logistics Innovations

## Introduction

• Cloud Launchpad

We are very excited to announce that OpsGuru has partnered with Canada’s Digital Technology Supercluster member Food-X Technologies to continue to enhance its eGrocery Management Solution (eGMS) to scale safe food delivery for retailers. OpsGuru will assist Food-X Technologies and other consortium members by delivering data platform capabilities for the eGMS solution built on Microsoft Azure. The Digital Technology Supercluster project consortium includes Food-X, Microsoft, OpsGuru, Adaptech, AltaML, ETG Consulting, Routific and Spud.

The COVID-19 pandemic has completely disrupted the business landscape. As our lives are changed forever because of the sweeping effect of the pandemic, it is more important than ever to carve a path forward with new ways to solve daily problems. We have all seen the queues in front of grocery stores in the past few months, and the emotional footages of people scrambling for daily essential goods in panic. That’s why when OpsGuru received the opportunity to assist in delivering innovations on food logistics, we knew right away we wanted to be part of it. Our strong passion for technology is fueled by knowing we can make a difference and in particular, helping to make daily supplies accessible to all those in need.

With cloud-native technologies lowering barriers to access computing power and storage, OpsGuru aims to help companies leverage cloud-native technologies to implement their visions and solve tangible challenges. Aside from the accelerating innovation in food logistics, we are steadfast in enabling companies to adopt cloud-native technologies. For established enterprises, we offer rapid migration to the cloud and cloud-native technologies adoption via the OpsGuru Cloud Launchpad. For start-up and small businesses, we offer programs to kickstart, reset and scale their businesses. As we specialize in rapid cloud deployments, Kubernetes and Data Analytics, we aim to make the cloud-native adoption journey of our customers to be effective and rewarding.

OpsGuru’s work can help enable your organization to adopt the cloud to boost your cloud-native journey, particularly in times where digital transformation has been accelerated.
