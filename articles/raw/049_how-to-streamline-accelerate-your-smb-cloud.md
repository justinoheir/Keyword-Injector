# How to Streamline & Accelerate Your SMB Cloud Adoption

## Introduction

• AWS

• Cloud Launchpad

• SMB

The most successful businesses in today’s fast-changing, digitally fueled society are those who take advantage of innovation and are data-driven. However, small and midsize businesses (SMBs) typically have fewer resources to fund the significant upfront investment that is often required to innovate, putting them at a disadvantage.

Are you looking to innovate your small or medium business in the cloud? Contrary to popular belief, cloud migration is not reserved for large companies with seemingly unlimited budgets and resources. With the right partner by your side and the use of out-of-the-box, cost-effective solutions, you can reduce your barrier of entry and time to market, successfully manage your cloud environment based on best practices, and even achieve compliance such as HIPAA, SOC2, or PCI-DSS, if relevant.

Research shows a trend of decision-makers for businesses of all sizes being drawn to cloud service providers and public cloud services, private cloud services or hybrid cloud environments. Some of the most important reasons for this shift involve the opportunities provided by cloud computing vendors, such as the ability to reduce costs, increase security, and improve agility.

By migrating some or all of your on-premise servers or infrastructure to Amazon Web Services (AWS), your business can achieve transformational results while revolutionizing your business processes and unleashing greater insights.

However, cloud adoption can lead to undue business interruption if it is not accomplished efficiently and securely. That’s why this process requires careful consideration of the complexity of your environment and the level of your in-house expertise.

By making AWS cloud adoption more easily accessible, affordable, and efficient, OpsGuru unlocks the innovation potential of every business, whatever its size. In this article, we’re discussing how our cloud adoption solution, Cloud Launchpad, can help you ensure your company is successful in the cloud while keeping more money in your pocket.

## Achieving Rapid Cloud Deployment

Built on years of experience in AWS cloud adoption solutions, the OpsGuru team has developed Cloud Launchpad. This streamlined cloud adoption solution provides a five-step roadmap along with personal coaching on the best practices of AWS cloud design and operations.

In a few as five days, Cloud Launchpad looks to reduce common errors companies experience establishing their cloud foundations. The solution also helps SMBs build the internal expertise and technical experience they need to own, operate, and continue to evolve on their own cloud environment while meeting their new technology goals.

Here are some of the benefits that SMB owners can achieve with the help of our Cloud Launchpad solution:

• A reduced cloud learning curve so your team can become self-sufficient in your cloud environment faster.

• Security and reliability guardrails.

• Increased cost savings to reduce the barrier to entry.

• Accelerate your time to market with a shorter cloud adoption timeline and faster deployment of solutions.

• Compliance readiness for standards such as HIPAA, SOC2 and PCI.

• The ability to extend beyond the Cloud Launchpad with ownership of the infrastructure as code codebase.

## Bosa’s Roadmap for Success

Bosa Development has been a leader in the real estate industry in Western Canada and the United States for over four decades. With headquarters in Vancouver, British Columbia, Bosa Development’s legacy IT infrastructure was distributed across three geographic locations and could no longer keep up with the growing demands of its rapidly expanding business.

OpsGuru worked with Bosa to architect and deploy a secure AWS foundation leveraging Opsguru’s Cloud Launchpad before doing a “lift-and-shift first” migration strategy for their Windows workloads, taking advantage of the CloudEndure Migration service.

With the help of OpsGuru’s Cloud Launchpad and AWS, Bosa now has a more secure, reliable and scalable IT infrastructure that supports the company’s business goals.

OpsGuru also ran a series of hands-on Cloud Launchpad training workshops to equip the Bosa team with AWS cloud best practices to leverage in the coming years. These enablement sessions produced a comprehensive set of operational playbooks and documentation covering AWS architecture and day two operations to empower the Bosa team to rapidly manage their cloud environment efficiently and independently.
