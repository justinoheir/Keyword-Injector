# OpsGuru Achieves Amazon API Gateway Service Delivery Designation

## Introduction

• AWS

OpsGuru is proud to announce that it has achieved the Amazon API Gateway Service Delivery designation, demonstrating our expertise in leveraging APIs at any scale to enhance our customers’ security, scalability, and efficiency.

The API Gateway Service Delivery Program distinguishes AWS Partners who have demonstrated deep technical knowledge, extensive experience, and a consistent track record in deploying Amazon API Gateway services to customers.

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. It acts as a “front door” for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from backend services.

Being a part of this elite group of AWS Partners highlights our proficiency in AWS services and opens up unique collaborative opportunities with AWS so we can streamline API management, bolster security, and improve performance and scalability for our valued customers.

In addition to the Amazon API Gateway Service Delivery designation, OpsGuru also holds AWS Lambda Service Delivery, AWS Resilience Services Competency, AWS DevOps Competency, AWS Migration Competency, AWS SaaS Competency, Microsoft Workloads Competency, AWS Networking Competency, Amazon EC2 for Windows Server Delivery, Amazon EC2 for Windows Server Delivery and the Amazon EKS Delivery.
