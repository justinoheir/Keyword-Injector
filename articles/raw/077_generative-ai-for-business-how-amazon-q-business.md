# Generative AI for Business: How Amazon Q Business Delivers 10x ROI

## Introduction

• Data and AI

• Generative AI

• Innovation

Information is power, but accessing that power can be a challenge when it’s locked away in silos and scattered across outdated systems. Organizations are under increasing pressure to do more with less in 2025’s economic climate. However, many still struggle with fragmented knowledge systems, leading to wasted time, missed opportunities, and hindered innovation.

Enter Amazon Q Business—a generative AI-powered assistant designed to reshape how enterprises access and leverage their information. Businesses can leverage Amazon Q Business to unify information access, improve organization and discoverability, and ensure robust security.

So, what does this mean for your business? Simply put, it means less time spent searching and more money saved. But before adopting any new technology, it’s essential to understand the financial impact. In this post, we’ll break down the costs and benefits of Amazon Q Business to help you make a confident, informed decision.

## The Hidden Cost of Productivity Lost Due to Information Access

The average knowledge worker spends up to 30% of their time searching for information across disjointed systems. At an annual average wage of $50,000, that 30% translates to $15,000 in lost productivity per employee. The financial impact becomes immediately evident when you scale that across your organization.

While some searching is inevitable, excessive time hunting for information hinders productivity, stifles innovation, and ultimately impacts your bottom line. Fortunately, AI offers a powerful solution.

## What is Amazon Q Business and Why Does It Matter?

Amazon Q Business is a generative AI tool designed specifically for enterprises. It connects your organization’s data sources—such as SharePoint, Salesforce, and Amazon S3—and provides users with contextual, permission-aware answers in a secure, conversational interface.

“To boost productivity with GenAI, you have to get people to consistently use GenAI tools. In the 2024 Gartner Digital Worker Survey, digital workers who used everyday AI tools or applications for work purposes at least once a week saved an average of 3.6 hours per week.”

Unlike traditional enterprise search tools, Amazon Q Business leverages large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and other deep learning techniques to deliver relevant, understandable, and immediately actionable results.

The result? Less time digging, more time doing.

## 4 Key Features of Amazon Q Business

From secure access to real-time answers and automation, Amazon Q Business is designed to improve productivity and simplify how teams interact with their data.

1\. Secure, Role-Based Access: Ensures that users only see information they’re authorized to access.

2\. Real-Time Answers: Uses advanced text-based AI and neural networks to generate real-time relevant responses.

3\. Scalable Integrations: Connects easily to a wide range of enterprise data repositories.

4\. Application Automation: Power users can build and publish AI-driven apps to automate repetitive workflows.

Whether you’re looking to improve knowledge sharing, automate everyday tasks, or simply make better use of your existing training data and data sets, Amazon Q Business is built to scale with your needs.

## How to Estimate the Cost of Amazon Q Business

To understand the potential savings Amazon Q Business can deliver, it’s important to look at the full picture:

1\. The cost of user subscription

2\. The cost of Indexing

3\. The cost of engineering and human management

4\. Any other AWS costs

Below, we summarize the four key cost components directly affecting recurring savings with Amazon Q Business.

## User Subscription

Amazon Q Business offers two subscription tiers to cater to different needs and budgets:

1\. Amazon Q Business Lite ($3 per user per month): This affordable option provides the core features you need for secure enterprise information search. It allows your team to:

2\. Amazon Q Business Pro ($20 per user per month): This offers advanced features like application publishing and Amazon QuickSight integration for power users.

1\. Securely connect to your company’s knowledge base and data sources.

2\. Get permission-aware answers in a conversational interface.

3\. Quickly sign on with their existing enterprise login.

Amazon Q Business Lite will be the perfect solution for enhancing knowledge sharing and productivity for many organizations. It’s a cost-effective way to empower your teams with quick and secure access to the information they need.

## Indexing Cost

Amazon Q Business leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to index your documents and provide accurate, up-to-date answers. We recommend Amazon Kendra GenAI Enterprise Edition for enterprise-scale deployments, security, and control over your knowledge base.

## Engineering and Human Management Costs

Document management requires ongoing effort, and tasks like prioritizing documents and managing metadata will likely require some dedicated human expertise, even with automation. To account for this, let’s budget for an engineer partially dedicated to these tasks, with an estimated cost of roughly $100,000 per year for every 500 users.

## Other AWS Costs

The cost of essential services like CloudWatch and CloudTrail for monitoring and logging, such that the overall solution follows the AWS best practices. These costs are estimated to be around 5% of your subscription and Kendra costs.

## How to Estimate the ROI of Deploying Amazon Q to Facilitate Information Search

Based on our previous cost examples, the estimated total cost of ownership (TCO) ranges from $101,000 to $206,000 per year for 100 to 500 users, assuming each user accesses 500 documents and makes 200 daily queries.

To assess the potential recurring savings, we’ve made some conservative estimates:

1\. Productivity Recovery: Limited to 10%, although research suggests potential losses of up to 30% due to inefficient search.

2\. Average User Salary: $50,000 per year, assuming the cost to maintain and manage the Amazon Q Business system is $100,000 per year per engineer.

Based on these assumptions, the chart below illustrates the potential productivity gains and cost savings you could achieve by implementing Amazon Q Business.

For 100 users, a 10% productivity recovery yields $500,000 in savings. At a total cost of ownership (TCO) of roughly $101,000 annually, that’s a 4x return on investment.

Scale to 500 users and the ROI can reach as high as 23x, depending on document volume and query frequency.

## Understanding Total Cost of Ownership and Engineering Costs with Amazon Q Business

It’s important to remember that engineering costs play a role in the overall cost-benefit analysis. As your user base grows, the need for dedicated engineering support increases, impacting the overall savings. For example, with 600 users, the recurring savings are lower than with 500 users, even with the same usage parameters. This highlights the importance of considering the full TCO, including engineering costs, when evaluating the potential benefits of Amazon Q Business.

## The Strategic Value Beyond Cost Savings

While the cost savings alone are compelling, the long-term value of Amazon Q Business goes beyond dollars and cents:

## Better Decision-Making

Access to accurate, contextual information enables teams to make smarter decisions faster. When your workforce is equipped with real-time, permission-aware answers, they can confidently move from analysis to action.

## Accelerated Innovation

By automating routine tasks and reducing friction in knowledge access, Amazon Q Business frees up time for creative thinking, strategic planning, and innovation. In short, your teams stop working on autopilot and start driving meaningful change.

## Turning Information Access into Measurable ROI

It’s natural to wonder if these numbers are too good to be true. While the potential savings from Amazon Q Business are significant, every organization is different. The impact of inefficient search and the costs and benefits of implementing Amazon Q Business will vary depending on your circumstances.

However, even with these nuances, the potential upside remains compelling. We’re still talking about the order of magnitude difference between the potential cost savings and the investment in Amazon Q Business.
