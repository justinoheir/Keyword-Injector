# OpsGuru’s Mency Woo Inducted into CDN Women in the Channel Hall of Fame

## Introduction

The annual Canadian Women in the IT Channel Recognition Luncheon recognizes women for their prominent roles in the channel and their profound impact on the tech sector. We are thrilled to share that OpsGuru’s Mency Woo was inducted into the Channel Daily News (CDN) Women in the Channel Hall of Fame at this year’s event.

Congratulations from the OpsGuru team on being recognized by CDN for your contributions to the IT channel\!

One of the biggest hurdles in the tech industry is the lack of representation of women in leadership roles and CDN highlights an elite subset of female executives whose insight and leadership within their respective fields leads to channel success.

Mency Woo, VP, Enterprise Transformation at OpsGuru, provides thought leadership to companies looking to adopt technologies and services from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud. Mency helps business executives make technology accessible and to harness the cloud’s potential to accelerate business growth.

“Mency’s common sense combined with her technical and implementation experience enables her to present the most affordable and suitable solutions that solve real business problems. This makes her a trusted advisor at Equinox Gold.” said Miller Dussan, VP of IT at Equinox Gold.

After over a decade of working with cloud computing, Mency cofounded OpsGuru in 2017\. Through roles spanning Consulting, Engineering, Product Management, Marketing and Partner Management, Mency helped establish OpsGuru as the preeminent Canadian multi-cloud consulting partner.

“I’m grateful to my mentors for the opportunities they have afforded me on my journey from Engineer to Executive. It is important that I now pay it forward, and I want to ensure that others receive similar guidance from me. Technology careers, including advancement and fulfillment, should be accessible to all genders and backgrounds.” said Mency.
